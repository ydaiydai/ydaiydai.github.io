									<h1>Swing It<br />
									</h1>
								</header>

								<p>
									"Swing It" is a game made in Unity using C#. My friend and I finished this
									playable game in 36 hours during LA Hacks 2019. We shared a mutual 
									interest in getting to fully know the ins and outs of Unity. This was 
									our first hackathon and we wanted to test our programming and 
									corporation skills. 
								</p>

								<p>
                                    My teamates and I worked together using the Agile Development 
										approach. Working on this project gave us a better mindset on teamwork 
                                        and greatly strengthened our collaboration skills.

									as we assigned each other to different roles, established different objectives, and had frequent meetups and discussions.

									Taking a week prior to LA Hacks to making a rough plan and learn by 
									ourselves Unity and C# concepts was definitely beneficial for us to 
									make this project work in less than two days. Though building a 3D 
									action game with a fully customized swing physics system was a 
									challenging task, this project was a great learning experience into 
									figuring out how Unity engine can be well utilized to be build a fun 
									3D game. Under the time constraint, My teammate and I also learned to 
									use existing sources and concepts. 
									<br>
									<br>	
									The entire code-base with its assets can be found on <a href="https://github.com/ydaiydai/Swing-It-">Github</a>. You can 
									also get a copy of the windows executables <a href="https://github.com/ydaiydai/Swing-It-Executable">here</a>
									<br>

								</p>

								<h2 style="text-align:left">Features</h2>

								<p>The game is based around manipulating the rigidbody in a 3D setting.
									In addition, the game utilized Unity's Post Processing Stack. The 
									key features of the game are listed below:
								</p>

											<ul>
												<li>Three unique playable levels with different objectives.</li>
												<li>Fully customized swing physics and rope mehcanics.</li>
												<li>Atmospheric lighting and environment.</li>
												<li>Post processed graphics.</li>
												<li>Full collider detection for level progress (failure or 
													completion) and respawn in each level.</li>
												<li>Funtional startup menu with level selection and graphical
													options.</li>
											</ul>

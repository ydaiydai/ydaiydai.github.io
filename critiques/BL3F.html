                                        Why It is a Failure</h1>
									<p>While the game has had a commercial success, <br />
                                        Borderlands 3 will fail to have a long-lasting great legacy.<br /></p>

                                    It has been more than a year since Borderlands 3’s initial release in September 2019. 
                                    By February 2020, it has sold nearly <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2020/02/06/borderlands-3-sales-near-8-million-copies/">
                                        8 million copies</a> and it is that this game has 
                                    been a commercial success. However, as my title suggests, Borderlands 3 is nowhere 
                                    near as successful as its direct predecessor: Borderlands 2. From fundamental game 
                                    design to its commercial strategy, Borderlands 3 fails to continue its precursor’s 
                                    long-lasting vigor.

                                    Players usually describe the Borderlands series as looter-shooters; in fact, 
                                    Borderlands 1 is often considered as the first looter-shooter with its “gazillions” 
                                    of guns. After that, games like Destiny and The Division followed Borderlands’ 
                                    footsteps into this new and thriving genre. Like any other looter game, the most 
                                    important focus of looter-shooter developers is replayability. Replaying the game 
                                    many times, creating different powerful characters, and grinding for more randomized 
                                    loots are what any looter is about. Borderlands 3 failed at this very aspect. To 
                                    encourage players to go back to the same stories and main campaign, the game must 
                                    avoid being too long and tedious. Looters especially looter-shooters should not chase a game 
                                    length of a single-player story-telling RPG. For comparison, based on my more than 10 
                                    playthroughs of Borderlands 2, the main campaign can take about 10-20 hours to 
                                    complete; Borderlands 3 on the other hand, would take more than 30 hours according 
                                    to <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2019/06/24/borderlands-3-will-be-about-35-hours-long-for-the-main-campaign#:~:text=Borderlands%203%20Will%20Be%20About%2035%20Hours%20Long%20For%20The%20Main%20Campaign,-by%20Imran%20Khan">
                                        gameinformer</a> and I can confirm this statement. Although players can always 
                                    find ways to speedrun the game, for average players, playing two playthroughs of 
                                    Borderlands 3 would take roughly the time to play Borderlands 2 four times. Getting 
                                    half the result with twice the effort discourages players greatly. Its great graphics 
                                    and gameplay are being overshadowed by long and tedious playthrough. 
                                </p>

                                    Another major flaw in Borderlands 3’s game design is its management of loots. A 
                                    looter cannot be a looter without its loots and Borderlands 3 has plenty of them, 
                                    too much in fact. Anyone who has enjoyed Borderlands 2 would agree that obtaining 
                                    legendary gears in that game is not an easy task. A player has to go through a boss 
                                    or a particular enemy many times to just have one drop of a legendary gear. This is 
                                    opposite in Borderlands 3 in which the player can have countless of drops of rare 
                                    gears in a single run. Some people might argue that the loot drop mechanics in 
                                    Borderlands 3 is better since the player can obtain what they desire easier, but 
                                    they miss the important point: A thing is precious when it is rare. The intrigue of 
                                    getting loots is the excitement of getting the gear that you have struggled for hours 
                                    and it is not the constant stimulus of “orange” (the color of legendary gears in 
                                    Borderlands series) dropping. If the character’s inventory gets filler quickly by all 
                                    of the best gears, the gears lose their significance. The additional rarity layer of 
                                    “anointment” on gears does add some worth to loot grinding, but it will only attract 
                                    the most hardcore gamers since most casual players are more interested in unique 
                                    legendary gears rather than their specific stats and perks. Together with the rather 
                                    controversial story (can be a whole new discussion), Borderlands 3 is quickly losing 
                                    player base. According to Steam Charts, <a href="https://steamcharts.com/app/49520#All">

                                    consistent 5000 daily active player-base more than eight years after its launch while

                                    similar number just one year after its initial release. Longevity is crucial for 
                                    looter-shooters and Borderlands 3 is failing on this aspect miserably.

                                    Again, some people defending the game might suggest that the small player base on 
                                    steam is caused by splitting of PC platforms. Statistically, I agree with the 
                                    argument, but even assuming the other platforms such Epic Games have the same player 
                                    numbers, the state of Borderlands 3’s player base is still far from optimal. On the 
                                    topic of different platforms on PC, it can be argued that this has hurt the franchise 
                                    in some ways. While Gearbox has claimed that Borderlands 3 has sold well on Epic Games, 
                                    the company’s decision of making the game exclusive on one PC platform for half a year 
                                    has divided its player base. Some fans on steam ultimately refuse the buy the game, 
                                    and many others can never see the game under a positive light though they eventually 
                                    purchase the game; the rather unimpressive reviews on steam can reflect this. The bad 
                                    PR relations continue to hurt the game’s reputation as DLCs and other additional 
                                    contents have been blasted with negative reviews. Although the commercial motivation 
                                    of having exclusivity contract is understandable, the move inevitably disrupted the 
                                    momentum of launch and stifled many gamers’ enthusiasm. Just recently, Borderlands 3 
                                    released its “Season Pass 2”. This kind of anti-consumer practice has been used before 
                                    in Borderlands 2, but it is much worse this time; after the exclusivity deal followed 
                                    by poor pricings and bad qualities of the game’s DLCs, this blatantly greedy move has 
                                    further damaged Gearbox’s relation to the level of irreparable. This greedy move of 
                                    trying to squeeze as many pennies as possible from consumers will quickly make the

                                <p>
                                    The poor design in game length and implementation of loot mechanics along with 
                                    Gearbox’s shameless anti-consumer practices have made Borderlands 3 a flagrant letdown. 
                                    While hurting the franchise’s reputation, Gearbox’s decision to gain more profit will 
                                    ultimately not lead to commercial success as the game has been quickly losing its 
                                    longevity, Borderlands 3 will forever live under the shadow of its glorious predecessor. 
                                </p>

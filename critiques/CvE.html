									<h1>Created vs. Established</h1>
									<p>Which is better in an RPG:<br />
										A created protagonist or an established protagonist? <br />
                                        It depends. <br />

                                    We can divide playable protagonist in single-player RPGs into two categories: Created 
                                    Protagonist and Established (non-creatable) Protagonist. Having a created protagonist 
                                    means that the player would usually personally customize a character based on his/her 
                                    own preferences, the player can choose the character’s gender, body type, personality, 
                                    and so on; the typical examples of games with character creations are the Fallout and 
                                    The Elder Scrolls series. On the other hand, having an established protagonist means 
                                    that the player can only play as one or a few characters who have been created and 
                                    established in the world setting with their own backgrounds, the player usually has 
                                    very limited customization options; a few examples are the Witcher series and most of 
                                    the single-player JRPGs. How a protagonist is implemented seems arbitrary, but there 
                                    is a connection between protagonist creation and the main focus of a game.

                                        Though outliers and unique designs always exist, the general pattern for the connection 
                                        mentioned is that if an RPG (especially open-world) values its sandbox elements (allows 
                                        the player a great degree of creativity) more, the game would normally allow the player 
                                        to create his/her own character; if an RPG values its stories more, the game would 
                                        usually give the player its own established character. Many great games can value both 
                                        aspects equally and have their owns implementation of character creation (Baldur’s Gate 
                                        3 for example), but in most cases, the pattern described is a secret of an RPG’s success.

                                    If you are quite clear on what I am suggesting, check out Cyberpunk 2077. As the most 
                                    anticipated game in 2020, Cyberpunk 2077 ended up being a disappointment. While a big reason 
                                    is CD Projekt Red’s deceiving marketing on last-gen consoles which triggered a massive 
                                    backlash from console players, PC players are not happy either. Even if we ignore the 
                                    problem of bugs (which is a big problem), we can see that Cyberpunk 2077 has struggles 
                                    greatly with its immersion. In the game, the player plays as his/her own customized V and 
                                    many gamers have failed to build a connection with the main character in Cyberpunk’s 
                                    story-rich sci-fi world. Judging from the game’s lifeless city and its horrendous AI 
                                    system, it is clear that CD Projekt Red did not aim to build a sophisticated sandbox, 
                                    they focused on the game’s campaign. The game with its character creation failed to either 
                                    engage the player with its great stories or give the player a fun sandbox. The reason why 
                                    custom character is not as impactful as a pre-built character is simple: the custom 
                                    character is a stranger. Movies and novels are engaging not because readers and watchers 
                                    can have their own custom characters but because they can read and watch interesting 
                                    stories of others. The Witcher series is so successful because the main character Geralt of 
                                    Rivia is well established (just imagine if every Witcher game lets you make your own 
                                    character). CD Projekt Red, tried new ways developing Cyberpunk 2077 after the Witcher series (Witcher 3 screenshot above) 
                                    but failed to make the new ways work. In addition, Cyberpunk 2077 only allows first-person 
                                    perspective in game and it makes the player even more difficult to establish a connection 
                                    with the protagonist. The game seldom shows the protagonist (unless through a mirror or while driving). When you cannot even see your 
                                    character in game, why should you even bother spending so much time customizing. 
                                </p>

                                        Some games, however, might work better if there were character creation. One example is 
                                        Kingdom Come: Deliverance. In the game, you play as Henry (as shown from the image on the left), the son of a blacksmith, and 
                                        your story begins after your village was raided and your parents were slaughtered. The 
                                        game is widely believed to have taken inspiration from 
                                        <a href="https://attackofthefanboy.com/reviews/kingdom-come-deliverance-review/"> The Elder Scrolls series</a>, 
                                        the paradigm of modern RPGs with character creation. But unlike The Elder Scrolls, Kingdom 
                                        Come: Deliverance does not have any character creation, every Henry looks the same; and 
                                        while the game has a lot to offer with its perks system, it lacks variety in the aspect 
                                        of character’s physical look. The protagonist’s lack of background story gives the 
                                        developers the room for character customization. Though the game’s setting is not 
                                        fantastical like The Elder Scrolls, having a character creation option might lift 
                                        Kingdom Come: Deliverance to a new level.

                                <p>
                                    Using pre-built character in a single-player RPG is generally a safer choice for game 
                                    developers. While it might limit the player’s level of creativity, it usually makes the game 
                                    more cohesive. Unless the game strongly emphasizes its sandbox elements or has much room for 
                                    a created protagonist, giving the player established characters will only lead to 
                                    <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/baldurs-gate-3/custom-characters"> few criticisms</a> if at all. Having 
                                    character creation sometimes is just icing on the cake. This is deep topic and many gamers 
                                    will have their own opinions, but most players, having experienced different games, would 
                                    agree with the article’s assessment on values of having created character or established 
                                    character in a game. But after all, each game is different and requires much deliberation 
                                    when figuring out whether a character creation is beneficial or not. 
                                </p>

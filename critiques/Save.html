                                    Saving is one of the most rudimentary functions a game has, and players might not realize 
                                    how important it can be for game design. It often defines a game. 
                                </p>

                                        For normal single-players, especially RPGs and other story-telling games, Game 
                                        saving is available to you almost 24/7, except special moments such as cutscene or 
                                        combat of course. Games such as Fallout: New Vegas are notorious for their long lists of 
                                        save files when the player is trying to load game. The motivation of this implementation of saving 
                                        system is obvious since players usually want to try out new routes or choices in 
                                        those games and having the option to save when wanted is helpful and encourages 
                                        players to fully explore what those games have to offer. In recent years however, 
                                        more choice-driven games are trying to limit the player’s ability to save to add 
                                        the weight of each choice and increase realism. Thronebreaker: The Witcher Tales for 
                                        example, only gives the player the option to save once in each chapter (at the start). Each chapter 
                                        consists of a whole map and the player has to take the consequence of each choice 
                                        along the journey; while it adds tensions in game moments, there are mix reactions on 
                                        the game’s save system from players. Kingdom Come: Deliverance has its own unique take 
                                        on saving system. In this Skyrim like RPG, the player can 
                                        only manually save the game if the in-game character consumes an item called “Savior 
                                        Schnapps”, a potion that has to be bought from merchants or brewed at an Alchemist’s 
                                        bench (as shown from the wording at the bottom right corner of the image above). Unlike any other RPGs I have played, this save system design blows 
                                        a fresh wind into a rather stagnant single-player RPGs’ save approach. Instead of 
                                        forcefully limiting the ability to save the game, Kingdom Come: Deliverance provides 
                                        a way for the player to save the game technically at any time while maintaining the 
                                        significance of the player’s decisions in the game world as saving cannot be taken for 
                                        granted. This creative approach deserves its applause.

                                    Gamers must have heard the term “checkpoint” in games, it marks down and saves the 
                                    player’s progress at a specific point in game. It is commonly used in adventure games. 
                                    In many platformers such as Crash Bandicoot, it is the only way for player to save progress 
                                    in a level. There have been more unique uses of checkpoint in the last decade. One example is Dark 
                                    Souls; in all Dark Souls games and other souls like, the player has to reach a bonfire like 
                                    checkpoint to save the character’s progress. If the player dies during the adventure, all 
                                    souls like currency will be gone and the player has to start everything again since the 
                                    last checkpoint (Different from platformers since Dark Souls technically has only one level: the world). The key concept of checkpoint is to segment the game into parts for the 
                                    player to go through; Dark Souls makes each segment difficult and painful for the player, 
                                    and the pain is actually what makes the game phenomenal. Beating a tough boss after many 
                                    attempts and reaching that brand-new bonfire is always other-worldly satisfying to the 
                                    player.

                                        If you want to see even crazier save mechanics, check out roguelike games. While 
                                        roguelike games usually are remembered for their procedural generated levels, they often 
                                        have somewhat extreme save system. Take Risk of Rain 2, a roguelike third-person 
                                        shooter for example; the player only has one life in a whole run. If the character is 
                                        killed, the whole game (a run) is over and the player has to play the whole game all 
                                        the way again (as shown from the image on the left). Incorporating it with the game’s randomly 
                                        generated levels and gears, the player is encouraged to try many runs, to collect more 
                                        items and get good (better). Many other roguelike games such as The Binding of Isaac 
                                        use similar designs. Randomly generated levels together with essentially "non-existent" 
                                        saving system makes roguelike games special and great.

                                    Saving, the most common feature in video games, can often make all the difference. From allowing 
                                    the player to save at any time to no save at all, a save system can make a game unique and 
                                    interesting in its own ways. As the game industry expands bigger and bigger, other 
                                    mind-blowing game save designs will definitely show up and make gaming even greater.

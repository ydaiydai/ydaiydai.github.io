                                <p>
                                    Working in this Game Engine was my first time learning the “lower levels” of Game 
                                    Development. I was thrown into a huge code base that I was unfamiliar with. It 
                                    became a great playground for me to be bold, try new things, and gain knowledge 
                                    either expectedly or unexpectedly. It could be frustrating sometimes as I tried 
                                    to figure out how things work. But being able to understand any code base quickly 
                                    is one of the most important skills a game engineer has to have. 
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    I got the opportunity to implement fundamental game features such as camera 
                                    culling and collision detection that we usually take for granted. Playing with 
                                    the code base and working on those features helped de-mystify game development. 
                                    Not only I learned to become a better engineer, but it also helped me become a 
                                    better designer as well as I now know more about game development in general.

                            <li>Tank Mini-game
                                <ul>
                                    <li>I built upon the physics system previously implemented for collision 
                                        detection to also include trigger volumes. To make the task more 
                                        meaningful, I developed a tank mini-game in-engine.</li>

                                    <li>In my first iteration, it was a mini-game where you control a tank 
                                        and eliminate all soldiers by driving over them. The game is won 
                                        when you eliminate all soldiers in the scene.</li>

                                    <li>I added the controllable client tank and implemented trigger 
                                        volumes on moving soldiers which destroy them (make them disappear) 
                                        when the tank hits them. I first made the client tank work with 
                                        physics by adding a physics component to it and expanding 
                                        functionalities in the physics manager. I also added the 
                                        debugRenderer method which draws sphere colliders on tanks and 
                                        soldiers for better visualization.</li>
                                    
                                    <li>I extended functions in objects and added trigger volume on soldiers. 
                                        Currently, the soldier removes themselves from the scene when their 
                                        trigger volume is entered by the tank.</li>

                                        <iframe width="950" height="500" style = "display: block; margin: 0 auto; padding-bottom: 2vw;"
                                        src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ueghCrSH4H4">
                                        </iframe>

                                    <li>For my second iteration, I improved and expanded the game which had 
                                        its trigger volumes cause a more variety of things, and made the 
                                        game more complex.</li>

                                    <li>I updated the code in soldier’s state machines. Instead of 
                                        disappearing upon elimination, Soldiers would play their DEATH 
                                        animation instead.</li>

                                        <iframe width="950" height="500" style = "display: block; margin: 0 auto; padding-bottom: 2vw;"
                                        src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/y5CvrWVmfMI">
                                        </iframe>

                                    <li>In addition, I added another layer of trigger volume onto the tank. 
                                        It is bigger compared to the one already on the tank. In videos, 
                                        the bigger sphere collider drawn by the debugRenderer is this bigger 
                                        layer of tank trigger volume for visualization. In the level, all 
                                        soldiers will start by walking around. They will start running once 
                                        they are near the tank which triggers the bigger volume. Soldiers 
                                        are now programmed in a way that they can start running at any moment 
                                        during their movement.</li>

                                        <iframe width="950" height="500" style = "display: block; margin: 0 auto; padding-bottom: 2vw;"
                                        src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UMQhxcz1qd8">
                                        </iframe>

                                    <li>To make the game more challenging and have losing conditions, I 
                                        modified the goal of the mini-game from just eliminating all soldiers 
                                        on sight to eliminating only the imposters among them. Whenever the 
                                        game level is loaded, soldiers are randomly assigned to be either 
                                        “real” or “imposter.” The player won’t be able to know who or how many 
                                        are imposters. The tank must avoid running over any real soldiers. 
                                        The game is lost if a real soldier was accidentally run over.</li>

                                    <li>To be able to distinguish between real soldiers and imposters, I 
                                        added the ability for the tank to slow down its speed once a real 
                                        soldier is nearby. It happens if any real soldier hits the bigger 
                                        trigger volume on the tank. The tank detects it and updates its 
                                        speed. It adds a good complexity to the game as sometimes an 
                                        imposter and a real soldier could both be close to the tank, the 
                                        tank slows down its speed but the player can’t be sure which one 
                                        is the real soldier. Some strategy is required to avoid failure. </li>

                                    <li>Lastly, I also added a timer on the screen. The game must be won in 
                                        under … seconds. It adds another layer of difficulty and makes the 
                                        game even more engaging. The player won’t be able to move the tank 
                                        if it hit an imposter or time is run out.</li>

                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ul>

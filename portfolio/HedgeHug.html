									<h1>Hedge Hug (Ongoing)<br />
									</h1>
								</header>

								<p>
									"Hedge Hug" is a 2D single-player narrative-driven roleplaying game made in Unity.
									It explores low self-esteem and social anxiety issues with interactive
									narrative puzzles and emotional gameplay moments, through the lens
									of a caring and sensitive hedgehog, Emma, a ceramic artist who
									struggles with loving and trusting herself in her daily life.  
								</p>

								<p>
									As an engineer in this ongoing Master's Thesis Project in a team of eleven, 
									I have been optimizing game tools and systems, developing game features 
									and puzzles.
								</p>

								<p><span class="image right"><img src="../images/Projects/Spike_Away_Concept.png"  alt="" /></span>
									I joined this ongoing year-long project in October 2021. The game is
									currently in pre-alpha. 
									<br>
									<br>
									In this project, I have worked on the game's dialogue system which directly 
									imports google spreadsheets into the game's dialogues, debugged and implemented
									the game's tween animation scripts on objects and texts, and implemented 
									prototypes for different game puzzles.   	
									<br>
									<br>
									It has been my first time joining a project midway in the process. While greatly
									expanding my knowledge on game progamming and development, I have gained new and 
									invaluable experience from debugging and improving existing scripts.
									As a member of this team, it has been a pleasure working with the game director, 
									fellow engineers, professors, and others. 
									<br>

                                <p>
                                    Hedge Hug is a 2D, single-player, narrative-driven role-playing adventure game. The 
                                    game explores low self-esteem and social anxiety issues with interactive narrative 
                                    puzzles and emotional gameplay elements, through the lens of a caring and sensitive 
                                    hedgehog, Emma, a ceramic artist who struggles with loving and trusting herself in 
                                    her daily life.   
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Inspired by movies like Kiki’s Delivery Service and games like The Average Everyday 
                                    Adventures of Samantha Browne, Hedge Hug strives to create likable characters to 
                                    evoke empathy, and portray realistic daily life moments, along with compelling and 
                                    interactive gameplay experience.  
                                </p>

                        <p>The biggest challenge I faced working on Hedge Hug was the fact that I did not join 
                            the team at the beginning. Some systems had already been developed and scripts had 
                            been written. Never had experience working on a game midway through development, I 
                            spent a lot of time trying to understand the code base. This was a great experience 
                            since now I have learned that it is common in the game industry and being able to 
                            understand any code base quickly is a crucial skill. </p>

                    <h2>Dialogue System Showcase</h2>
                        
                    <p>After understanding the code already written for dialogue, I first improved the system by 
                        utilizing spreadsheet to store dialogue texts in the editor following advice from my 
                        director. I faced some expected issues with special symbols (quotation marks). I solved 
                        by simply ignoring it. It wasn’t a pretty solution (luckily no dialgues had quotations) 
                        but it was a quick one. Just like what my Game Engine professor Artem Kovolovs said: “a 
                        solution doesn’t need to be pretty if it works fine, leaves it there.” </p>
                    
                    <p>I continued to polish and add new features on the dialogue system based on needs. One of 
                        the convenient features was the ability to skip text typewriter effect if the player 
                        wants to go through the dialogues quickly. It was harder than I anticipated to implement 
                        as it required deeper logics on Unity’s coroutine which I wasn’t familiar with. The 
                        knowledge I gained from this was helpful for my future projects as well. </p>
                   
                    <p style="padding-bottom: 1.5vw;">While ultimately Kach did not have a similarly fully physical 
                        environment, this prototype set a great foundation for our examine mechanic.</p>

                    <h2>Breathing Prototype Showcase</h2>
                        
                    <p>The breathing mechanic was a quick puzzle triggered in game when Emma is stressed (it is 
                        like a breathing exercise to calm oneself down). How it works is that the player holds 
                        the mouse to expand the sphere, and releases it when it hits the ring; upon hit, the ring 
                        will change its size, and the player continues to hit it until it is over. The player must 
                        hit all rings consecutively. An old prototype was already developed when I was assigned 
                        to take over. My task was to make its gameplay more natural and more challenging.</p>
                    

                    <p>The old system was already well-established so I built upon it. To make it more natural, 
                        I changed the mechanic to now that expanding sphere had to hit the inner side of the 
                        ring and the shrinking sphere the outer side of the ring (before both were hitting the 
                        inner side). This change actually killed two birds with one stone. Now the breathing 
                        felt more natural with better player feedback. It felt more “rhythmic.”It also 
                        dramatically raised its difficulty, now the speed of the game went much faster and the 
                        player might now react quickly enough to hit the ring consecutively.</p>

                    <p>In fact, the breathing puzzle became too difficult. To adjust this, I tweaked the area of 
                        collision for the ring and added a dynamic difficulty feature. The game would keep track 
                        of the number of times missing hits. Upon reaching some threshold, the area of collision 
                        would enlarge giving the player more frames to react. This simple fix prevented the player 
                        from being stuck in this quick puzzle. There was a quick slowdown in time the first time 
                        player is about to hit the ring. It served as a quick tutorial for the player.</p>

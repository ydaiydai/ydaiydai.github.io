                                        Kach is a First-person Horror Walking Simulator where you look for your missing sister 
                                        and explore an abandoned house. You will interact and examine interesting objects and 
                                        unveil the mysterious history of this house. 
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        Inspired by the video series called “The Mandela Catalogue” and games such as SOMA and 
                                        Amnesia, the game provides an immersive experience where the player can investigate a 
                                        world featuring a pixelated monochromatic art style.

                        <h2>Prototype Iterations</h2>
                            
                        <p>Kach all started from the prototypes my partner and I created and iterated upon. We 
                            iterated on prototypes six times in total, three each. We created and tested them with 
                            playtesters in three weeks, they were quick and effective for us to test different ideas 
                            and narrow down the game’s direction.</p>
                        
                        <p>We first experimented with the idea of developing a walking simulator where the player 
                            could interact with different objects to figure out puzzles. In the beginning, we were 
                            also inspired by the 2D game “Papers, Please.” To test a similar game mechanic, my first 
                            prototype let the player see from a top-down view of a table on which they could 
                            interact with three different objects. Creating prototypes as toys and not games, I made 
                            this a full-physical environment where the three objects can collide and trigger 
                            different results.</p>
                       
                        <p style="padding-bottom: 1.5vw;">While ultimately Kach did not have a similarly fully physical 
                            environment, this prototype set a great foundation for our examine mechanic.</p>
                        
                        <p>For my second prototype, I built upon my previous one, and tried to establish a “bad version” 
                            of a horror atmosphere. I tested two different creepy visual effects. I also unlocked the 
                            camera from being fixed (as we were leaning more toward making a walking simulator). The 
                            player now could also rotate objects (a feature kept in the end). I also added a cheesy 
                            jump scare that would be triggered after the player flipped the wooden board object.</p>

                        <p>This prototype was quick and basic, but it provided us with much valuable information. It 
                            inspired us to make a horror game with a unique art style.</p>

                            <p>My third and last prototype turned in a different direction compared to my last two. At 
                                this point, we have decided that our project would be a First-person horror game where 
                                you play as a PERSON. What if you are not a person? To answer this question of mine, I 
                                built a 3D greybox level and the character controller had the ability to fly (like a 
                                flappy bird). In addition, I experimented with a new visual effect which surprisingly 
                                felt futuristic (we did want to have the game set in a sci-fi world).</p>

                            <p>Its visual effect and character controller gave us new perspectives on how the game 
                                could work and feel.</p>

                        <h2>Pre-Production</h2>

                        <p>During pre-production, we used the Concentric Development approach, first focusing on 
                            working on our 3C’s (Character, Control, Camera). We polished our character controller 
                            to a high degree very early on. I implemented a stamina system for running as well as 
                            its head bob motion that also adjusts between walking and running. Some challenges we 
                            faced were refining the transitions between different breathing SFX states (running, 
                            stop running but not exhausted, stop running and exhausted) and optimizing camera 
                            sensitivity.</p>

                        <p>Implementing a robust character controller was a highlight of this project. Being able 
                            to polish it nicely early in development set a strong foundation for other feature 
                            implementations, making life much easier.</p>

                        <p>Since the beginning, I had been in charge of the examine mechanic. Our plan was to have 
                            the player able to focus on a specific object, rotate it, and zoom in & out. Making it 
                            work was not hard, but it was challenging to make it work well. One challenge I faced 
                            during pre-production was achieving the visual effect of blurred background during 
                            examination (to make the object selected more focused). My mechanic implementation 
                            conflicted with the game’s shader graph which modifies the screenspace globally. It 
                            prevented different cameras from having separate post-processing effects. Because of 
                            other production priorities, I was unable to resolve it. We had to give up on this 
                            little visual polish (luckily it was not an issue to players).</p>

                        <p>We held outside playtests since prototyping. Playtests were always helpful. Even though 
                            we didn’t listen to every suggestion, players provided fresh eyes on our game. We had 
                            usability and accessibility in mind early since pre-production. After evaluating 
                            feedback and discussing it with each other, we frequently adjust the environment and 
                            added more player options to improve immersion and accessibility.</p>

                        <h2>Full Production</h2>

                        <p>I fell in love with production tools such as burndown charts during the full production 
                            of Kach. Working in sprints, my partner and I always planned and assigned tasks along 
                            with their priorities and time estimation. With the clarity it provided, we were always 
                            on top of our schedule. Spreadsheets were our best friends. We also composed other 
                            spreadsheets such as an asset sheet for all asset tracking and a bug tracker.  While 
                            our team structure made production much easier than a bigger team, the use of 
                            spreadsheets in Kach gave me valuable experience in how to organize game production. 
                            It helped me tremendously in my future projects.</p>

                            “crazy” aesthetic of the game when we were randomly testing our shader’s parameters. 
                            We instantly fell in love with the pixelated monochromatic feel and decided to go with 
                            that. It turned out to be the right choice. It was a great lesson for me because I was 
                            afraid that it was too late to make such a dramatic overhaul during full production. 
                            While it is not recommended, I learned that there could be “wild cards.” Even during 
                            full production, we should always stay alert to the opportunities to radically 
                            transform the design of our game for the better. With enough caution, we need to know 
                            when to take a risk.</p>

                        <P>I was extremely proud of the great production Kach had. The game in the end was on 
                            schedule for publishing with great polishing. We knew when to stop adding new features 
                            and strive to make what we had better.</P>

                        <p>We soon published Kach on Steam, and it quickly received many positive reviews and 
                            gained traction on YouTube as it was played by players worldwide.</p>

									<h1>Kach<br />

								<p>
									"Beakon" is a 3D horror game made in Unity. It was a 15-week project 
									made in a team of 4 as my USC Intermediate Game Project.
								</p>

								<p>
									As the co-director, designer, and engineer in this team,
									Designed the overall idea, narrative, and game loops; implemented the game's 
									gameplay mechanics and features; also helped 
									recruit two other teammembers to join our team; conducted formal playtests and held 
									review meetings.

									Following guidance from Richard Lemarchand, I partnered with a fellow student 
									Bhargav Modha and created this 3D horror game. It was developed in collaboration 
									with students from Berklee College of Music and Otis College of Art and Design. 
									<br>
									<br>
									This is the first complete game I developed from start to finish. I learned about the four
									phases of game development: Ideation, Pre-production, Full-Production, and Post-Production.
									I also created game documents such as Design Goals and Game Design Macro. I also utilized
									Burndown Charts and Bug Tracker. In addition, I held formal playtests and participated in 
									milestone review meetings. I was able to 
									become much more proficient in Unity. I also tried other areas of game development
									that I was not familiar with such as 3D modeling. More importantly, the making of 
									this game gave me invaluable experience in communication, collaboration, and leadership.
